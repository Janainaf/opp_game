## About this Project

In this project, I created a browser-based, word guessing game: a "Phrase Hunter" using JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming). 
It selects a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

Players win if they manage to guess the phrase - but  they have to be smart, because they only have 5 guesses/hearts.

To make things easy, the code keeps track of the letters already picked - so players can't pick them twice by mistake. 
(orange for wrong guessed letters, blue marine for well guessed ones).
